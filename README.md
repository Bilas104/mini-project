# mini-project
Run the command 'make' on the terminal to create executable files client and server.

This is a modification of the libcoap implementation available at [libcoap-3](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap) & [libcoap-minimal](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap).

This is a menu-driven libcoap implementation which responds accordingly to the request made by the server.

The response (messasge) is encrypted using the AES-128 to provide security.

The client then decrypts that response and the message is displayed for the client to see.
